/**
 * `Preview`'s own read-only rendering of a `codeBlock`. Built from
 * `CodeBlockLowlight` (not the plain `CodeBlock`), and deliberately keeps a
 * **real** `contentDOM` (`NodeViewContent` below): an earlier version of
 * this replaced the entire DOM with custom-rendered, per-line-highlighted
 * spans, which broke native text selection, ProseMirror treats a NodeView
 * with no `contentDOM` as opaque for selection purposes, the same way you
 * can't text-select inside an image node. Keeping the real contentDOM means
 * `CodeBlockLowlight`'s own highlight-via-decoration plugin (the exact
 * mechanism the editable editor already uses) highlights this too, for
 * free, correctly across multi-line constructs a per-line approach
 * couldn't, and native browser selection/copy over the actual text keeps
 * working.
 *
 * Line numbers are a **separate sibling gutter**, not interleaved into the
 * content: counted from `node.textContent.split('\n').length` and rendered
 * as their own column next to (not inside) the real code text. This is
 * deliberate, not incidental, splitting the text itself into per-line DOM
 * nodes is exactly what broke selection the first time; a gutter that's
 * merely visually adjacent, kept in sync by matching `line-height` (see
 * `www/src/styles/typeset.css`), never needs to touch the actual content.
